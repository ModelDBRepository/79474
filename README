README file for genesis code used to run simulations in:

"Ionic currents underlying difference in light response between type A
and type B photoreceptors." by Blackwell J Neurophysiol. 2006 95:
3060-72

Main scripts are

photomain102.g type B photoreceptor (used to make figures 2A-C; 4B,
5A, 6)

photomainB102toA19.g type A photoreceptor (used to make figures 2A-C;
5B, 7-9)

photomainB102toA9t?.g type A photoreceptor with different speed sodium
currents (used to make figure 2D)

These main script files require / use most of the other script files.

To run the simulation you need to have chemesis2.1 installed Also, you
will need to edit the
filepath="/home/avrama/chemesis2.0/photo-spikes/final/"
to point to a directory that exists on your computer.

The first set of four simulations use current injection, and simulate
800 ms of time. So, these run relatively fast.  The second set of
simulations uses light as the stimulus, and simulate 15 s of time.
Thus, these run relatively slowly.  Output from each current injection
level, light intensity and duration are placed in a separate file.

Note that the light intensity is controlled by the level1 parameter,
which varies by sqrt(10) for each 10x increase in intensity.  This is
to compensate for various non-photoreceptor mechanisms controlling
light intensity.
